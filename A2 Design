Previous description: 
FuelIt will be a website that compares all fuel prices from your chosen location to find the cheapest rate from most major fuel 
companies such as Shell, BP and 7 Eleven. This will allow drivers across New South Wales to save money by detecting prices around 
their area according to fuel types. Users will be selecting their fuel type then our website will analyse fuel price data through 
the API plug in finding the best possible fuel price from multiple fuel stations.

FuelIt will be able to generate and pull fuel prices from the API plug in and display it on a map through using a Google Maps plug in. 
It will also contain a search function in which the user can select what company and fuel type the drivers want. Location filtering 
will also be one of the major functions involved, drivers will be able to filter the distance from a current or certain location and 
results will be generated accordingly. Once the destination is selected, distance from the user to their chosen location will also appear. 
To further extend this website, an application for iOS may be created, to enable more mobility for users who may not always have access 
to a computer when they are in desperate need for fuel. For more money conscious users, a fuel trend graph may be implemented to allow 
these individuals to track the patterns in fuel pricing and fill up when they believe it is the most cost-effective period, thus being 
an extended feature.



Unambiguously demonstrates the expected outcomes of the specified Minimum Viable feature in a professional manner.
